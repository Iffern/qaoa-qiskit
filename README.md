# QAOA (and its versions) adaptation for IBMQ

This repository presents an adaptation for [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf) and three of its versions,
[Warm-Started](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10095.pdf), [Recursive](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08980.pdf) and [Warm-Started Recursive](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10095.pdf), for IBMQ.

Implementation has been prepared in a few versions:
- local, for which the quantum part of the code is run on simulator locally
- hybrid, for which thw quantum part is run remotely, on IBMQ, but the classical one is run locally
- remote, for which both parts of the code are run on IBMQ

## Limitations for various versions
